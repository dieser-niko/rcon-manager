# rcon-manager
A collection of scripts for managing my minecraft server.

I'm using RCON in order to control the server without the need for a secondary tool/dashboard to get access to the console.

The RCON port is not open to the public, so even though the connection is unencrypted, it shouldn't matter because the script is on the same machine as the minecraft server.
